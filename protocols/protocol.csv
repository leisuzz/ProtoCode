0,2.2 Synthetic RNA via in vitro Transcription,"The MEGAscript™ T7 Transcription Kit (PN AM1330, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First, custom DNA gBlocks with T7 promoter sequences (IDT, Coralville, Iowa) were created for each fusion variant (Table S2). The transcription reaction was set up with the following volumes using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit: 2 µL ATP solution, 2 µL CTP solution, 2 µL GTP solution incubated, 2 µL UTP solution, 2 µL 10X Reaction Buffer, 8 µL IVT gBlock at 1E6 copies/µL, and 2 µL Enzyme Mix. The reaction mix was incubated at 37°C for 4 hours, and then 1 µL of TURBO™ DNase was added to the transcription reaction and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. In vitro transcription (IVT) products were initially evaluated for yield and purity by qPCR. This was done by creating two different reaction mixes, one with reverse transcriptase and one without, which tested for any remnant DNA before being used in contrived testing. Once the IVT fusion products were determined to not contain DNA, they were quantified with a singleplex dPCR assay for ACTB."
0,2.8 Parallel comparator testing,"DNA and RNA isolated from the Discovery and Cureline FFPE clinical samples were parallel processed through Discovery Life Sciences’ QiaSeq MultiModal panel (64 DNA genes and 6 primary genes for RNA fusions, recommended input mass of 200 ng DNA and 200 ng RNA with at least DV20%). Data were processed through Qiagen’s CLC Workbench bioinformatics workflow to generate variant call files and reports. DNA isolated from the Dartmouth Hitchcock samples were processed using Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 and TruSight Tumor 170. Data processing was performed using the Torrent Suite and the TruSight Tumor 170 v1.0 Local App respectively. Sequencing summary statistics are provided in Extended Table S8. Samples were considered indeterminate and excluded from the clinical concordance analysis if the sample did not generate at least 20 reads for a particular target region."
0,2.3 Amplitude-modulation dPCR assay construction,"The primer-probe systems adopted one of three configurations: an allele-refractory mutation system (ARMS) with or without blocking oligonucleotides, a variant-sensitive probe, or an exon-specific design to identify exon-exon RNA fusion junctions (Figure 1). To begin, we synthesized and screened multiple primer-probe systems in singleplex using synthetic templates designed to represent a variant of interest. For the DNA-specific ARMS and variant-sensitive probe systems [20], the strandedness of the system (targeting Watson or Crick), the thermodynamics of the penultimate base pair mismatch, and the orientation with respect to nearby variant sites were considered during the design phase. Once systems were identified that worked well in singleplex and in pairwise duplex, the same principles of amplitude modulation in dPCR that have previously been demonstrated on qPCR [17] were applied. This approach allows multiple targets to be detected in the same color channel by tuning the reaction chemistry and probe concentrations, then applying Poisson statistics to interpret the observed dPCR data. Primer and probe concentrations were empirically optimized under multiple different concentration and thermal cycling conditions to achieve terminal fluorescent amplitude values that allowed for fluorescent intensity separation of all variants (Table S3). Due to the close genomic coordinate proximity of some of the DNA variants, the DNA targets were split into two separate wells to minimize cross-target amplification. For the RNA-specific fusion targets, a separate reaction included a reverse-transcription PCR step to generate cDNA. We also sought to incorporate knowledge of the prevalence and co-occurrence of certain biomarkers into the assay design. For example, to reduce the risk of calling errors that may be elevated in co-positive samples (e.g. EGFR L858R and EGFR Exon 19 deletion), prevalent variants were encoded in different color channels."

1,2.4 Amplitude modulation digital PCR reaction setup and cycling (DNA),"DNA PCR reactions were set up using the following volumes: 2.4 µL 5X dPCR QuantStudio™ Absolute Q™ Master Mix (PN A52490, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 2.9 µL oligonucleotide primer-probe mix (Table S3), and 6.7 µL of isolated genomic DNA. Contrived samples and natural specimen FFPE were tested at 4.18 ng/µl. Each dPCR reaction mix was vortexed three times for five second pulses, spun down in a microfuge, and 9 µL of the dPCR reaction mix was added to each well of a QuantStudio Absolute Q MAP16 Plate Kit (PN A52865, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Next, 12 µL of QuantStudio Absolute Q Isolation Buffer (PN A52730, ThermoFisher Scientific) was added to each well on top of each reaction mix. The final quantity of genomic DNA that makes it into the system, as part the 9 µL input, is 21 ng for contrived and FFPE samples. The wells were sealed with QuantStudio Absolute Q strip caps (PN 332101, ThermoFisher Scientific). All testing was conducted on one of two QuantStudio Absolute Q Digital PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Thermal cycling was performed as follows: (1) Preheating at 96°C for ten minutes, (2) 35 cycles consisting of denaturing (96°C, 15 seconds), followed by annealing/extension (58°C for 30 seconds). Terminal fluorescence intensity data was collected in all four available color channels. Along with the reaction mixes, every plate included a positive control (gBlocks of synthetic targets in each color channel) and a negative control (consisting of only human genomic DNA background). Positive control primers for EGFR Exon 2 (DNA) were included in each well, respectively. Primer and probe sequences are described in Table S1 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.
